Documentation:

This simple ransomware program was written for educational purpose using Python. This
piece of software heavily relies on tkinter and cryptography.fernets library. The
encryption state is heavily inspired from NetworkChad's technique and the implementation
for the UI is written by myself. 

To encrypt documents on the same folder, run the python program on a test directory with
at least 1 file in it. Then, a tkinter window will show up to alert the user about the
ransomware attack. It will ask the user to send bitcoin to a bitcoin account (which is 
a random string of characters through smashing of keyboard). Once the "transaction" has
been completed, the user has enter the password which by default is just "admin".

When the user types the key on the entry box and hits "Enter" key, the program should
exit and decrypt all the files damaged by the malware.

If, for some reason the user had closed the software, the user can still re-run the program
and it will check if the key exists. DO NOT REMOVE THIS KEY. If it exists, the files
were still encrypted and waits for the decryption key. The user can just enter the key and 
the files would be decrypted naturally. After that, the key will be destroyed.

As warned, DO NOT REMOVE THE KEY UNTIL ALL TEST FILES ARE DECRYPTED.
